    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My journey into software development started in a trade school, where I was learning to fix cars. As a kid, I was always fascinated by how things work. I enjoyed taking things apart to either fix them or understand their mechanics.
  This curiosity eventually led me to an automotive apprenticeship at a local gas station, where I worked in the shop and at the front desk while attending trade school.
  That is when I first encountered the intersection of technology and problem-solving, often troubleshooting technical issues with the computer system and network.
  During this apprenticeship, I also learned how to code by creating web forms to replace paper forms and inserting the data directly into a database.

    <p>
      Iâ€™m currently focused on mastering C++ and Python, two languages at the core of modern software development, especially with the rise of AI.
  In addition to my academic work, I build side projects that explore artificial intelligence.
  I clean datasets and fine-tune machine learning models to stay hands-on with real-world applications.
  These projects not only sharpen my technical skills but also deepen my practical understanding of AI architecture.
